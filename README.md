# Biharmonic Deformation: An Introduction

Biharmonic deformation is a powerful technique used in geometry processing, computer graphics, and computational geometry for smoothly deforming 3D shapes or meshes. It is particularly useful when we want to deform a shape while maintaining its smoothness and structural integrity. This method finds applications in mesh editing, shape interpolation, and surface modeling.
